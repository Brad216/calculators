Provide a Calculator API to determine affordability and financial forecasting  

The calculator should aim to show a the user what their cash position will be if they donâ€™t make the purchase or make a an alternative one. e.g. If the person buys a 20 000$ car instead of a 30 000$ car over a 5 years period for x Interest. 

The Calulator will also be able to show you how much you could save on interest in your homeloan if you put the money you save on the buying the 20 000$ over the 30 000$ car into your bond.
