Provide a Calculator API to determine affordability and financial forecasting  


The calculator should aim to show a the user what their cash position will be if they don’t make the purchase or make a an alternative one. e.g. If the person buys a 20 000$ car instead of a 30 000$ car over a 5 years period for x Interest. 



The Calulator will also be able to show you how much you could save on interest in your homeloan if you put the money you save on the buying the 20 000$ over the 30 000$ car into your bond.   

It would be great to also have a "what if" functionality.  This may be a combination of multiple APIs


The calculator can also provide users with different investment and savings opitons.this will inform the user of better options instead of just buying a vehicle. These options should include investments such as fixed deposits, shares, normal savings accounts, unit truts, tax free saving accounts, etc.
